# Lab 2 Geo-Tagged Tweets with Word Art

# Description of Lab

In lab 2, we are tasked to use a script "tweets.inynb" to search through geo-tagged tweets using latitude, longitude, and the radius buffer of the coordinate. 
This script allows us to find the tweets in that location and save it as a CSV file with all the data containing the location and the tweet, with the CSV format data we use this data on WordArt.com
