# Lab 2 Geo-Tagged Tweets with Word Art

# Description of Lab

In lab 2, we are tasked to use a script "tweets.inynb" to search through geo-tagged tweets using latitude, longitude, and the radius buffer of the coordinate. 
This script allows us to find the tweets in that location and save it as a CSV file with all the data containing the location and the tweet, with the CSV format data we use this data on WordArt.com

## Findings from data and differences between Word Arts

Using the data from the tweet search I was able to create different word arts that are similar to one and another but have different words in them, Comparing Seattle's Word Art of the search parameter "BLM" and Los Angeles. The biggest word for Seattle is "Co" and the biggest word for Los Angeles's word art is "The". One similarty between the two is that BLM is one the big words as well, but it appears that it is more common in LA's tweet search. I would conclude that because there is much higher population in LA, that could result in more tweets therefore making the words stand out more. One differences I see between LA and Seattle is "LAPD". I assume LAPD means Los Angeles Police Department, and it was one of the common words found when running the script. 

I also chose to compare a province/city outside the United States because since "BLM" was a movement mainly involving the United States police brutality, I wanted to find what other countries are commonly tweeting about this topic. In the word art of Vancouver, BC I noticed the word "Peace" showing up a lot which is not common in the U.S tweets. Possible reasons for the word peace to come up among tweets in Vancouver can show that Vancouver wishes "Peace" for the U.S. A similarity between the three locations is of course the word "BLM" because that was the search parameter.

Common differences between the three word art, is all of them indiciate where the tweets are from, for example on the word art of Seattle, we see "Seattle" as one of the key words, on Los Angeles word art we see "LAPD", and on Canada's word art we see "USA". 

## Improving research 
Research can improved in the future by location multiple locations because since some places are more populated than others, there can be lack of consistent data. For example, if we were to locate tweets in a less populated area such as Yakima, WA we would find less tweets on this topic because there is just much less people there, and if we are comparing the three places, we would want to find the populated places of all three locations. Other ways to improve research is to look for other search parameters that involve the same topic, such as typing out "Black Lives Matter" instead of "BLM". Reducing sample bias would improve our research a lot because there will be less inconsistencies in our data. 

Looking for multiple sources also will improve research, for example like creating a script that searches through Facebook and other social media sites can help lower the bias when looking for data because if we are specfically looking on Twitter, we will be able to find a good amount of data but comparing to other social medias will help us complete our data.
